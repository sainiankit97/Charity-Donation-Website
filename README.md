WE ARE THE HOPE OF INDIA

Our goals are to provide safe and adequate housing as well as educational opportunities to as many of the over 500,000 vulnerable girls on the streets of India as is possible. If we do not do this work, they face abuse, rape, even death. But more than that, our goal is to provide this shelter, care, and education so that these young women have a chance to interrupt the the cycle of poverty and move in the direction of a thriving life. For themselves and their future families.
